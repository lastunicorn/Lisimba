bug: when updating the current contact, the list of contacts should refresh itself without redisplaying all the contacts.
bug: when clicking the x button the application does not close from the first time.

as a user, when i double click the Phones, Emails, WebSites, Addresses, Dates or MessengerIds tree view items, i want a new corresponding item to be added in the list.

as a user i want to have icons for the Add Contact, Delete Contact and Properties menu items. (2)

as a user, when i import contacts and the opened address book already contains a similar contact, i want to be asked to overwrite, merge or skip each contact. (10)
	- create a wizard for import operation.

as a user i want to be able to open an address book from a url.
